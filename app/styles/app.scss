// Import the partials
// We leave off the '_' and file extension here

@import "base/variables";

// Foundation
// load the foundation thru css
// instead of "require('style!css!foundation-sites/dist/foundation.min.css')"
// in app.jsx file
// Advantage is that we can make changes to global foundation class setting in one place
// We can also change foundation setting using normal css override but it will be messier

// 1st. load in the 'foundation-setting' file (scss setting file)
@import "base/foundation-settings";
// 2nd load the foundation
// We need load the first file because custom changes was made there,
// instead of in node-modules
// so if the 1st file was loaded, foundation will always refer to the setting in that file
@import "foundation";
// 3rd tell foundation to include everything
@include foundation-everything;


// Component
@import "components/container";
@import "components/page-title";
@import "components/todo";
